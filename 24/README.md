## [2.4 Calculator](https://warren1001.github.io/IAS_Calculator/24/)

### v0.15.0
- Literally everything should be correct for 2.4, with the exception of off-hand Normal Attack for Characters (untested).
- All wereform animations should be correct in all cases.
- All dual wielding skills should be correct.
- All breakpoints where EIAS would be <0 should be correct.
- All sequence skills (Frenzy, Double Swing, Dragon Claw, Fists of Fire, A5 Merc Normal Attack, etc) should be correct.
- Impale should be correct.
- Strafe bug was fixed in D2R/2.4, 2 frame attack is actually reachable.
